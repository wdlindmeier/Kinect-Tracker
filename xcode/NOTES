Open CV & Kinect
================

TODO
=============

x Fill screen with Kinect camera data
x Import Open CV
x Blob Detection:	
	x output threshold blobs of color image and depth image
x Get blobtracking working?
Get color information from blobs
	>> try running threshold on specific color ranges so we can have 2 colors next to each other
		Maybe to speed up, we can turn colors on and off as a pref
	If above doesn't work, get the color of detected blobs
Draw box over the camera data w/ GL

NOTES
=============
